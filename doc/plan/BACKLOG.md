# General backlog
- build a general import feature for transaction/account/category data (reusable UI/API flow, dry-run preview, validation report, and idempotent import strategy)
- the login page doesn't make sense. why should I create a book at first page? it should be at second page if current user has no book associated. there should be a dedicated page in setting tab for user to create new/delete/edit book
- Accounts: the page should default list all accounts (with their balance) other than to create new one. when clicking on one account, details should be given. there can be a general "three dots" button on top right to make add/edit/deletion operations.
- the bottom nav is moving when upper content is full page - make it fix and hover regardless the upper content
- make "new" tab a big plus other than text
- language should bind to account
- make day/night view of the page, switch should land in settings. current color can be night view, day view should be more viral.
- add a user(what's the correct name?) field transaction
